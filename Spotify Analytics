# For this project, I downloaded Spotify data from Kaggle, specifically "Spotify top  50 songs of 2021".
# Then, I created a table to insert Spotify data into.
# Finally, I performed analytics on the data using SQL. 

#Creating the table: 
CREATE TABLE BIT_DB.Spotifydata (
id integer PRIMARY KEY,
artist_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_id varchar NOT NULL,
popularity integer NOT NULL,
danceability decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
energy decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
key integer NOT NULL,
loudness decimal(5,3) NOT NULL,
mode integer NOT NULL,
speechiness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
acousticness decimal(6,5) NOT NULL,
instrumentalness text NOT NULL,
liveness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
valence decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
tempo decimal(6,3) NOT NULL,
duration_ms integer NOT NULL,
time_signature integer NOT NULL 
)

#Then I inserted the Spotify Data .csv into the table.

#Next, I explored the data using the following SQL. 

SELECT *
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata;

#Then, I loooked at the top five most popular songs and their data.
SELECT *
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
ORDER BY popularity desc
LIMIT 5;

#Then, I looked at how many times each artist appeared on the top 50 songs list.
SELECT distinct artist_name, count(artist_name)
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name
ORDER BY count(artist_name) desc;


#Then, I determined the avg popularity, danceability, and energy by artist and track. 
SELECT
artist_name
,track_name
,avg(popularity)
,avg(danceability)
,avg(energy)
FROM BIT_DB.spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name, track_name

#Then I determined who the Top 10 artists are by popularity
SELECT track_name, artist_name, popularity
FROM BIT_DB.spotifydata
ORDER BY popularity desc
LIMIT 10
