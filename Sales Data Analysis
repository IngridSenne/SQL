# This is an exploratory analysis of sales data from a store.
# First, I get to know the data.
# Then, I start to ask relevant questions and explore.

# 1. What is the total sales made by each agent?

SELECT emp.FirstName, emp.LastName,
ROUND(SUM(inv.total), 2) as 'Total Sales'
FROM chinook.employees emp

JOIN chinook.customers cust
ON cust.SupportRepId = emp.EmployeeId

JOIN chinook.invoices inv
ON inv.InvoiceId = cust.CustomerId

WHERE emp.Title = 'Sales Support Agent'
GROUP BY emp.FirstName;

# 2. What were the sales totals for 2009?

SELECT SUM(Total) as '2009 Sales Total'
FROM chinook.invoices
WHERE InvoiceDate BETWEEN '2009-01-01' AND '2009-12-31';

# 3. What are the total number of customers from each country?

SELECT COUNT(CustomerID), Country
FROM chinook.customers
GROUP BY Country;
